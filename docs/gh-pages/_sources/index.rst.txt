pod-porter documentation
===============================================================================================================

Why is this called pod-porter?

A porter is someone who is responsible for carrying luggage to it's destination. In the same way, pod-porter
is a tool that helps you carry your containers from one instance of Podman_ / Docker_ to another instance.

This tool if very inspired by the HELM_ project.  I wanted something similar to HELM_ but for compose files.  Also,
I tend to favor Podman_ over Docker_, so I wanted a name to coincide with it, but being that both Podman_ and
Docker_ both follow the `Compose Specification`_ this will work with both of them.

I also hope that this tool can help people who want to learn HELM_ cause they are very similar in structure.

In the same way that HELM_ is a package manager for Kubernetes_, pod-porter is a package manager for Podman_ and
Docker_.
